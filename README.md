Anserd is a doubt solving platform for the youngsters who are always curious and eager to know more and more but are bounded by the lack of proper access to the resources and platforms

## Features

- Any User can make new category for the questions and start asking questions in them.
- All the asnwers are provided by the peers and any number of users can answer any question without any bounds
- the answers are ranked based on the votes of the viewers, which in turn rank the writers.
- high ranking writers get some extra privilledges 

## Tech

Anserd uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJs] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Numerous NodeJs Packages] - for implementing various features 
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
